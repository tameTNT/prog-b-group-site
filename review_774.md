Interest of content
Acceptable
Some pages lacking compared to others, for example: CS contributions to medicine

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Good
Pages use the same font but one uses dropdowns, another uses images on the left and another with them on the right: this is inconsistent

Quality of written presentation
Good
Transport is written well but the others are lacking and open source is not very textual. Spelling and grammar is all fine

Validity of HTML
Excellent
Alt tags used on all images; seems to be mobile friendly; pop up to view more links is a nice touch

Evidence of collaboration
Lots of recent commits on the last day before submission
Work not very evenly distributed (3 commits min vs 39 commits max)
